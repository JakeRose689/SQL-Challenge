# SQL-Challenge

# Purpose

In this assignment, I was tasked with creating a database structure to perform analysis of employee data from Pewlett Hackard between 1908-1990. I first had to design an ERD to best approach the task, then create the tables in pgAdmin 4, upload the data, and perform my queries. 

# Assignment

I completed the following mandatory tasks:
* Create an image file of your ERD.
* Create a .sql file of your table schemata.
* Create a .sql file of your queries.

I did not complete the optional bonus assignment:
* (Optional) Create a Jupyter Notebook of the bonus analysis.
